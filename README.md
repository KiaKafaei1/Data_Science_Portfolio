Welcome to my data science project portfolio. In this repo, you can find my work on some real world data science problems and solutions that will include state-of-the-art machine learning models and statistical methods. Most of my projects will be demonstrated in Jupyter Notebook, a tool I find great for communicating findings. Enjoy! 


## Yelp Business Dataset

In the yelp Business data set a lot of insight can be gained about different businesses
in different cities. In this notebook the focus was set on the city of Charlotte in the
state of North Carolina, US and what potential investors may want to look for when
investing in a business in Charlotte.

A Comprehensive Descriptive analysis was performed on the businesses of Charlotte, investigating specifically
the differences between open businesses and businesses that has had to close shop. Answering the question: What insights can be drawn 
to help other businesses in the area remain open? 

Furthermore Predictive analysis was performed on the two KPI's:  Rating and the-number-of-reviews. 

Methods used: 
- Different visualization methods 
- Topic Modelling
- Different Machine Learning methods - Logistic Regression, Linear Regression and Random Forest.
- Chi squared significance test
- Feature importance analysis

## Predicting Mackerels
This project was made in collaboration with 2 colleagues; Frederik Bjare and Stanley Frederiksen.

The goal of this project is to make predictions on how many Mackerels will be caught
in the future - within various time intervals and different subareas of EU waters -
based on the Fishmap-dataset. This could be useful for the fishing industry in able
to tell where the likelihood of catching most mackerels would be.

Models and Methods Used:
- PGM (Probability graphical models) and Generative Stories
- Autoregressive models
- Multiple correlated Timeseries models
- Imputation method
